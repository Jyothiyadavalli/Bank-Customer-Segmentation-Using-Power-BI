#  Bank Customer Segmentation using Power BI

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on **Bank Customer Segmentation** using **Power BI** to analyze customer demographics, transaction behavior, profitability, and risk levels.  
The objective is to convert raw banking data into **actionable business insights** that help banks improve customer retention, revenue growth, and risk management.

##  Business Problem
Banks generate a large amount of customer and transaction data, but without proper analysis it becomes difficult to:
- Identify **loyal and high-value customers**
- Detect **high-risk customers**
- Reduce customer churn
- Improve targeted marketing strategies

This project addresses these challenges using **RFM analysis and interactive Power BI dashboards**.
